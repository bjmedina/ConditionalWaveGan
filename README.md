# Towards Improving Adversarial Audio Synthesis with Gated Recurrent Units

Baseline code and model, as well as MIDI dataset is taken from https://github.com/corynguyen19/midi-lstm-gan, which tackles a similar problem to ours. We expand on this by testing the 
use and efficiency of GRUs as plausible substitutes to GANs employing LSTM-based RNNs.
